This is the project based on Project Wordle from [Joy of React](https://www.joyofreact.com/).

While the course provides a starter template with helper functions and pre-written CSS, I chose to challenge myself by building this project from scratch without using the template.

This project is built with Next.js, TailwindCSS, and Framer Motion to create an interactive word-guessing game.

Bonus points for GOOSE or GEESE words.
