This is the project based on Project Wordle from [Joy of React](https://www.joyofreact.com/).

While the course provides a starter template with helper functions and pre-written CSS, I chose to challenge myself by building this project from scratch without using the template.

This project is built with Next.js, TailwindCSS, and Framer Motion to create an interactive word-guessing game.

Progress:

- [x] Implement word grid
- [x] Implement word animation
- [x] Managing row state
- [ ] Adding winning and losing states
- [ ] Adding keyboard
